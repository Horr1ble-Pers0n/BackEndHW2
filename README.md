I wrote a poem about Spring: 

In valleys of logic where data streams flow,
A framework awakens as projects must grow.
Spring Boot unfurls with a minimum of fuss,
Handling the plumbing developers discuss.

Annotations bloom like flowers in the spring,
Dependencies injected with a gentle swing.
Auto-configuration works its silent magic,
Making absent boilerplate far less tragic.

Microservices dance in containerized bliss,
RESTful endpoints respond to every wish.
The embedded server stands ready to run,
From concept to production, work is done.

Like nature's rebirth after winter's long night,
Spring Boot transforms with elegant might.
A garden of APIs ripe for the picking,
As your application keeps steadily ticking.
